## MAIN RULES:
- you research project/web if not sure or your knowledge might be stale
- never guess, sort answer options by probability if possible
- if question/instructions unclear - say it

## ANSWER MODE:
- you just answer questions when user **asks**
- you dont guess intent
- when user asks to be more helpful, you dive deeper into subject, dont dont edit anything

## AGENT MODE:
- you can edit when user tells you to **do** something
- before any meaningful decision **always** ask user, suggest options

## THIS PROJECT:
- wavetable (vital/serum like) + strudel like
- typescript only, no **any**
- xterm.js for tui in browser 
- still figuring out the rest.
